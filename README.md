# NeuroNet

I wanted to add a Repository und I'm motivated to make a Neural Network. Thats why this exists. It can create Networks and runs them. You can use an API to send and get data from and to the netw ;) It's my first Repo

# Stage of the Project

I'm working on it right now. It can create neural networks, but running them? Nope, still can’t. It keeps saying dumb stuff like "Created a neuron," which… yeah, I actually did code that part, but it’s still too lazy to do anything useful—basically like a piece of paper ;)

# Requirements

- .NET SDK 10.0 or newer
  (Try to use it with lower versions i havened tested it yet)
