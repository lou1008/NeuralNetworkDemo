# NeuralNetworkDemo

I wanted to add a Repository und I am motivated to make a Neural Network. Thats why this exists. I have no Idea what the Neural Network should do ;)

# Stage of the Project

I'm working on it right now. It hasn't done anything yet, except for saying some stupid things like "Created a neuron," which isn't true because I haven't programmed that yet. Because I'm just being lazy, like a piece of paper ;)

# Requirements

- .NET SDK 10.0 or newer
  (Try to use it with lower versions i havened tested it yet)

# Getting Started

How to run the Project:

## Linux & MacOS

Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lou1008/NeuralNetworkDemo.git
```
Go into the folder and start the Programm
```
cd NeuralNetworkDemo
dotnet run
```

## Windows
