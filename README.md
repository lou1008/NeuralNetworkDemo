# NeuroNet

NeuroNet is a from-scratch neural network framework in C# (.NET 8), built for learning, experimentation & architectural exploration.
This project is unfinished on purpose, because learning is the point.

# Stage of the Project

NeuroNet is currently in its **early pre-release stage**.

At this point, the project provides a **working core implementation** for creating, saving, loading, and running simple neural networks. The internal architecture is being actively refined and may change significantly between versions.

## What works
- Core neural network structure
- Network creation and execution
- Serialization and deserialization of networks
- Command-line based execution (CLI)

## What does not work yet
- Training / learning algorithms
- Public API stability
- Advanced network types or neuron variants
- External integrations or bindings

Breaking changes are expected. This pre-release is primarily intended for **development, experimentation, and architectural validation**, not for production use.

# Requirements
